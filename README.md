# Sorting Algorithm Visualization
This is a simple Sorting Algorithm Visualizer ( Only Bubblesort in specific ) using Tkinter. <br> <br>
Tkinter is a Python binding to the Tk GUI toolkit. It is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit, and is Python's de facto standard GUI. Tkinter is included with standard Linux, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X installs of Python. The name Tkinter comes from Tk interface. <br> <br>
Running   &nbsp; "python -m tkinter" &nbsp; from the command line should open a window demonstrating a simple Tk interface, letting you know that tkinter is properly installed on your system, and also showing what version of Tcl/Tk is installed <br> <br>
